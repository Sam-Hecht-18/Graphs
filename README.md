# Graphs
After finishing the Algorithms course I took in fall 2022, I decided to implement some 
of the graph algorithms we learned about.

This program can be compiled with the makefile by typing 'make' in the command line

This program has functinoality for creating Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) trees
with Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford's algorithms as well as creating Minimum Spanning
Trees (MST) with Prim's algorithm. It can handle directed and undirected graphs.
